## 7. AI Agents as Solutions
Ng suggested that businesses should actively consider purchasing existing AI solutions instead of investing solely in in-house development. This market-driven approach recognizes the rapid evolution in AI capabilities and encourages organizations to utilize proven solutions to leverage AI more effectively. By doing so, companies can save time and resources while accessing innovative tools that advance their operational capabilities. This call for pragmatism is particularly relevant as AI technology continues to democratize access.
